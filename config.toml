Examples abound, from Tweets and Instagrams, to the geolocation of merchant ships or the movement of soccer players on the pitch. The Internet of Things is impelling an acceleration of the proliferation of DDS with sensors increasingly embedded in cars, personal devices, and infrastructure. We see digital data streaming as the newest evolution of computing - from batch and online processing of transactions to the continuous processing of streaming data. As with any historical shift, the opportunities for value creation are endless, and research must contribute to our understanding of the phenomenon. The mission of the DDS Lab is to be at the forefront of knowledge and understanding of DDS - from their generation and processing to their productive and strategic use."
